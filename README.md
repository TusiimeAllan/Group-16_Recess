Word TAsk Server

This project involves web interface that connects to a database.

The data in the database can be entered through the client.exe program that is created after compiling the client.c file.

The server program does tasks like:
1. Doubling a string
2. Reversing a string
3. Replacing a character from a string
4. Deleting a character from a string
5. Encrypting a string
6. Decrypting a Character

The String after being processed, its saved to a text file.

The index page has a script that will upload the details to database.

You will be able to view processed jobs and the jobs that are waiting to be processed by the server.
